# üîß Risk Assessment Threshold Reference

Complete reference of all numerical thresholds used in the rule-based risk assessment system.

## üìä Component Weights

```python
RISK_WEIGHTS = {
    "transaction_patterns": 0.25,    # 25%
    "protocol_interactions": 0.30,   # 30%  
    "asset_concentration": 0.20,     # 20%
    "activity_frequency": 0.15,      # 15%
    "failure_rate": 0.10,           # 10%
}
```

## üéØ Risk Level Boundaries

```python
RISK_LEVELS = {
    "VERY_LOW":   0-20,     # Highly conservative wallet behavior
    "LOW":       20-40,     # Generally safe behavior patterns  
    "MEDIUM":    40-60,     # Some concerning factors
    "HIGH":      60-80,     # Significant caution required
    "VERY_HIGH": 80-100,    # Multiple severe red flags
